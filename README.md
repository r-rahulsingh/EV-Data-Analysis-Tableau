## Project Overview : 
This Tableau dashboard explores electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends in the U.S., covering both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). It provides insights into market growth, vehicle efficiency, and regional distribution to better understand the evolving EV landscape.

## Key Insights : 

Rapid Growth in EV Adoption: EV numbers have surged since 2015, driven by tech improvements, lower costs, and government incentives.

BEVs Outpace PHEVs: BEVs account for 77.6% of all EVs, showing a strong consumer shift toward fully electric vehicles.

Tesla Leads the Market: Tesla dominates U.S. EV sales, with the Model Y and Model 3 being the most popular choices, reflecting strong brand trust.

Regional Adoption Differences: States like California show the highest EV usage, supported by better infrastructure and local incentives.

Battery Range Still a Concern: The average electric range is just 67.83 miles, indicating a need for better battery tech to support longer drives.

Awareness of Incentives Lacking: Many EVs show unknown eligibility for CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) incentives, pointing to a knowledge gap among buyers.
